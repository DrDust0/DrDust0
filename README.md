## __About me__
Hi I'm Salvatore, a programmer based in Leghorn, Tuscany, Italy.

I recently finished my studies of Game Programming at TheSign Academy.
I decided to study Game Programming because I always had a burning passion for videogames since i was a little kid.

Currently i am working on various personal projects (which i will soon add on this page), while waiting to work for bigger projects.
